# Restaurant-Management-System

This is a C++ project I had made during my final year of highschool using MS-DOS/Turbo C++. I have employed several OOP principles while designing this project and have implemented intensive binary and text file handling.

The purpose of this program is to simulate a restaurant management system which provides an interface for both the customers and the management. You can use the program as a customer or as an admin/management member.

The customer module provides the following functionalities:
- Seat selection for reservation or walk-in customer
- Display of all menu items
- Placing an order
- Billing and checkout

The management module provides the following functionality:
- Visual table display with status (empty/occupied/reserved)
- Display customer details
- Search customer by name
- Search customer by customer ID
